install squid-cache using squidman 3.1 (it will be in /usr/local/squid)
replace /usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf and cachemgr.conf with the ones in this directory
make sure the hostname of the machine maches the actual hostname
	if not, set visible-hostname to the correct hostname in squid.conf
run: sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/squid/var/cache
put hosts.squid to /etc/hosts.squid
add the specs in hosts to /etc/hosts
run "sudo /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -z" to set up swap directories
run "sudo /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -NCd1" to enable debugging output and make sure "Ready to serve requests" shows up.

squid should work (-NCd1 is not necessary for normal operation)
after installing squid you can run setup.sh
